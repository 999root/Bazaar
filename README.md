## 🌟 Features

- **Browse Files**: Navigate files in a clean, organized directory structure.
- **Download with Ease**: Direct file downloads with a simple click.
- **Dockerized Deployment**: Quick and straightforward setup using Docker.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get Bazaar up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

To use Bazaar, make sure you have:

- **[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)** installed on your system.

### 🛠 Installation

#### 1. Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd Bazaar
```

#### 2. Build the Docker Image

Build the Docker image from the Dockerfile:

```bash
docker build -t bazaar .
```

#### 3. Run the Docker Container

Run the Docker container to start the Bazaar application:

```bash
docker run -p 8080:80 bazaar
```

This command will start the application on port 8080. Feel free to modify the port by changing the `-p` flag as necessary.

#### 🐳 Pulling from Docker Hub (Optional)

If you’ve uploaded the image to Docker Hub, you can pull it directly instead of building it locally:

```bash
docker pull your-dockerhub-username/bazaar:latest
docker run -p 8080:80 your-dockerhub-username/bazaar
```

## 🖥 Usage

Once the container is up and running, open your web browser and go to:

```bash
http://localhost:8080
```

You should now see the **Bazaar** interface, where you can easily browse and download files.

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

Bazaar can be customized by using environment variables and volume mounts. Here’s an example of how you might configure it:

```bash
docker run -p 8080:80 \
  -e APP_SETTING=custom_value \
  -v /path/to/local/files:/app/files \
  bazaar
```

### Environment Variables

- `APP_SETTING`: (Optional) Custom application settings.

### Volumes

Mounting a local directory as a volume allows you to share files easily with Bazaar. For instance:

```bash
docker run -p 8080:80 -v /path/to/your/files:/app/files bazaar
```

---

## 🛠 Development

For developers looking to modify and test Bazaar, consider the following setup:

1. Use Docker's volume mapping to sync changes made on your host machine to the container:

   ```bash
   docker run -p 8080:80 -v $(pwd):/app bazaar
   ```

2. This command allows live reloading of the application code when you make changes locally.

## 🤝 Contributing

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature-branch`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m "Add feature"`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature-branch`).
5. Open a pull request.

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.
